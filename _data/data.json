    On May 15th, the best and the brightest will come together to compete in
    StartupBus Americas VII, the continent’s most epic competition – combing the
    magic of a hackathon and a road trip to create the ultimate adventure on wheels.

    We’ll be hitting all the raddest hot spots and tech shops as we make our way
    to Boulder Startup Week, where buses from 3 countries will converge in the
    quest for StartupBus glory. This year each bus is going to have a theme, so
    you can choose your own adventure. Finalists will get the chance to pitch on
    stage for Techstars at the historic Boulder Theater.
