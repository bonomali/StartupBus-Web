APPEARANCE RELEASE
For good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, I authorize StartupBus/Silicon Valley Foundry (“Producer”) and its respective parents, affiliates, subsidiaries, licensees, successors and assigns (Producer may also be referred to as “you”) to make use of my appearance in connection with programming on COIN (“Program”) and in connection with Producer or otherwise.
I agree that you may tape and photograph me, and record my voice, conversation and sounds, including any performance of any musical composition(s), during and in connection with my appearance and that you shall be the exclusive owner of the results and proceeds of such taping, photography and recording with the right, throughout the world, an unlimited number of times in perpetuity, to copyright, to use, to modify, and to license others to use, in any manner, all or any portion thereof or of a reproduction thereof in connection with the Program or otherwise. I acknowledge and agree that the Program is based on a concept (“Concept”) created by Producer and Producer owns and controls all rights therein and I shall have no right to develop or exploit the Concept, the Program or any aspect or element of the Program in any manner whatsoever. For purposes of clarity, I expressly waive any and all moral rights I may have in connection with my appearance.
I further agree that you may use and license others to use my name, voice, likeness and any biographical material concerning me or other personal materials (e.g., still photographs, film clips, home videos, etc.) which I may provide, in any and all media and in the promotion, advertising, sale, publicizing and exploitation of the Program throughout the world in all media, an unlimited number of times in perpetuity. I further represent that any statements made by me during my appearance are true, to the best of my knowledge, and that neither they nor my appearance will violate or infringe upon the rights of any third party and I shall indemnify you and hold you harmless from any liability or claimed liability in connection with my appearance, materials furnished by me (if any) and/or any words spoken by me in connection with the Program.
I agree that, during my participation in the Program and continuing for a period of twelve (12) months from the completion of my participation in the Program (“Term”), unless I receive Company’s written approval, which Producer may grant in its sole discretion, I will not (a) appear in any television programming on any television network or online, other than the Program on COIN, except for one-off interviews which I shall be permitted to do;, or (b) write, post or otherwise render services for any online vlog or blog wherein I discuss any aspect of the Program (including the fact that it is being produced) and/or, Producer,. I hereby acknowledge and agree that, if Producer desires, I am interested in the possibility of providing my personal services to Producer and/or Producer in connection with future cycles of episodes of the Program, and, in consideration of the opportunity to be chosen to participate in future cycles of episodes of the Program, I hereby grant to Producer the right, during the Term, to require that I negotiate in good faith, within Producer’s usual parameters, a talent agreement for my services in connection with the Program, which will include Producer’s standard terms and conditions and compensation. If the Term has expired and the foregoing negotiations with respect to such talent agreement do not result in an agreement, I shall thereafter be free to appear in any television program for any television network, provided that if I receive a bona fide offer to appear in a television series/program for any U.S. network within two (2) years following expiration of the Term, Producer hall have the right to match the financial terms and conditions of such offer. I agree to notify Producer in writing of the financial terms of any such third-party offer that I would like to accept, and Producer shall thereafter have a period of thirty (30) days to match and pre-empt such offer by giving me written notice of its acceptance of the financial terms contained in the notice to Producer. If Producer matches such terms and conditions, then I agree that I shall be obligated to enter into such agreement with Producer and decline the third-party offer. If Producer fails to match and pre-empt the third-party offer, I will be free to accept such third-party offer. In the event the third-party offer shall not materialize into an agreement with the third party, Producer’s matching right shall be in full force and effect with respect to any succeeding third-party offer(s).
I hereby waive any right of inspection or approval of my appearance or the uses to which such appearance may be put. I acknowledge that you will rely on this permission potentially, at substantial cost to you and hereby agree not to assert any claim of any nature whatsoever (including without limitation, claims based on invasion of privacy, defamation or right of publicity) against anyone relating to the exercise of the permissions granted hereunder and in no event will I have the right to seek or obtain injunctive or other equitable relief. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to obligate Producer to exercise any of the rights herein granted.
Except as authorized by Producer, I will not, or authorize others to, receive or generate any monetary advantage from my appearance on the Program or use or disclose to any party any information learned as a result of my participation in the Program. Further, I shall not make or authorize others to make any statement to any media service with respect to the Program or otherwise publicize, advertise or promote my appearance on the Program, without Producer’s prior written approval in each instance. Disclosure by me in violation of the foregoing shall constitute and be treated as a material breach of this Appearance Release which will cause irreparable harm to you and/or Producer.
This is the complete and binding agreement between us, superseding all prior understandings and communications with respect to the subject matter hereof. This agreement cannot be terminated, rescinded or amended except by a agreement signed by the parties. I warrant that I am at least 18 years of age (or, if not, that my parent or legal guardian has agreed to the foregoing and signed below) and that I have the full and unrestricted right to enter into this agreement.
