On May 15th, the best and the brightest will come together to compete in the most epic competition the Americas has ever seen – combing the magic of a hackathon and a road trip to create the ultimate adventure on wheels.

For the seventh year in a row, @TheStartupBus will depart from Tampa, FL and go head to head with buses from 6 cities to see who can create the most innovative business on their way to Boulder, where you'll get the chance to make your pitch on stage at Techstars' Boulder Startup Week.

The Florida Bus has chosen to focus on building tech solutions that better the Food & Beverage industry. It's a vertical ripe for innovation with a huge potential impact on Florida's state and local economies.

In a space as competitive as Food & Beverage, both distributors and restauranteurs need standout solutions to make their customer experience a cut above the rest.  StartupBus Florida knows innovative tech solutions that give owners the right business intelligence, analytics and optimization capabilities is the fuel that will sky-rocket this industry to new levels.

However, we're not going to sugarcoat it, the ride to Colorado will be tough. We'll be stopping in cities all over the US and we're not going to tell you what they are. You're not going to get much sleep and you may have to fight people off to charge your devices. You'll be pushed past your limits and will go through ​*all*​ the feels. But it'll all be worth it when you find greatness on the other side.

We can promise you that the few, the proud, the brave who are selected to join our elite crew will leave with the experience of a lifetime, a new group of best friends/business partners, a whole new view of what's possible and plenty of tales from the trenches.

So what are you waiting for? Apply now for the chance to join the most exclusive community in tech and see if you have what it takes to hit the pedal to the metal.
