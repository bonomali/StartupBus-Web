I, (“Participant”), acknowledge that I have voluntarily applied to participate in an event under the management of StartupBus/Silicon Valley Foundry (“StartupBus”).

As consideration for being permitted by StartupBus, Silicon Valley Foundry, and any lessor of the event facilities and equipment, to participate in these activities and use the event premises and facilities, I forever release StartupBus, the Lessor, any StartupBus affiliated organization, and their respective directors, officers, employees, volunteers, agents, contractors, and representatives (collectively “Releasees”) from any and all actions, claims, or demands that I, my assignees, heirs, distributees, guardians, next of kin, spouse and legal representatives now have, or may have in the future, for injury, death, or property damage, related to my participation in these activities, the negligence or other acts, whether directly connected to these activities or not, and however caused, by any Releasee, or
the condition of the premises where these activities occur, whether or not I am then participating in the activities.
I also agree that I, my assignees, heirs, distributees, guardians, next of kin, spouse and legal representatives will not make a claim against, sue, or attach the property of any Releasee in connection with any of the matters covered by the foregoing release.
