<p>On May 15, the best and the brightest will come together to compete in an epic competition – combining the magic of a hackathon and a road trip to create the ultimate adventure on wheels.</p>

  <p>We’re looking for the best devs, designers and entrepreneurs to join StartupBus Vancouver as we travel from Vancouver to Boulder and go head-to-head with teams from 6 other cities across North America to to see who can create the most innovative business on the way.</p>

  <p>We’ll be stopping in a bunch of cities along the way and we’re not going to tell you what they are. The only thing we can tell you is you’ll be heading to Boulder Startup Week, where you’ll get a chance to pitch to members of TechStars Boulder. Push yourself past your limits and compete for StartupBus glory in what’s been called “the most intense hackathon in the world.”</p>
